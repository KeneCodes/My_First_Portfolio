    <h2>About This Page</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      I am Kenny, and I am starting my journey as a frontend developer. I am
      learning how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This
      portfolio shows some of the things I am working on as I improve my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently learning frontend web development, focusing on HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript. I am working on small projects to practice and improve my
      skills step by step. Although I am still mastering these technologies, I
      am excited about growing and building useful websites in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy learning how to code because it lets me create things that people
      can use and enjoy. Every day, I spend time practicing and exploring new
      topics in web development. I am excited to keep growing and getting better
      at building websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would love to connect with others who share my interest in coding. Feel
      free to reach out to me on social media or check out my projects on
      GitHub. I am eager to learn from others and grow in this field.
